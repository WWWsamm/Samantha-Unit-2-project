        <h4>Racism is one of the biggest problems around the world. Racism evades people of color of their rights.</h4>

                <h2>Race/Color Discrimination</h2>
                <p>When a candidate or employee is treated negatively because of his or her race or other related personal attributes, this is known as racial discrimination (such as hair texture, skin color, or certain facial features). When someone is treated poorly because of their skin tone, this is referred to as color discrimination.

The act of treating someone negatively because they are married to (or affiliated with) someone of a particular race or color is another example of race/color discrimination.

When the victim and the discriminator are of the same race or color, discrimination may have taken place.</p>

                 <h2>Work Situations</h2>
                 <p>Any facet of employment, such as hiring, firing, salary, job assignments, promotions, layoffs, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment, are all prohibited by law.</p>

                 <h2>Harrassment</h2>
                 <p>Harassing someone based on their ethnicity or color is forbidden.

Racial insults, rude or disparaging comments regarding a person's ethnicity or color, or the display of racially inappropriate symbols are all examples of harassment. Simple teasing, casual remarks, and isolated, minor episodes are not criminal, but when they occur frequently or severely enough to foster an objectionable work atmosphere or have a negative impact on hiring decisions, harassment is (such as the victim being fired or demoted).

The harasser may be a coworker, the victim's boss, a supervisor in a different department, a client or customer, or a person who is not an employee of the firm.</p>
